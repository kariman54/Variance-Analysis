Variance Analysis Report Using Power BI

In this project, 
I created a Variance Analysis Report using Power BI to track and analyze the budget
versus actual sales performance across multiple products over a specific period.

Key Features of the Dashboard:

1-Total Budget vs. Total Actuals:
The top section of the dashboard displays the Total Budget and Total Actual sales figures, 
along with the variance in both absolute numbers and percentages, allowing quick
identification of how closely actual sales are tracking against the budget.

2-Total Variance Visualization: 

A gauge chart visually represents the overall variance between budgeted and actual sales, 
highlighting areas where the budget was not met.

3-Product-Level Breakdown:

This section shows a breakdown of Total Budget and Total Actual Sales by product (Aspen, Carlota, and Quad), 
along with the variance and variance percentage for each product, helping to pinpoint specific 
underperforming or overperforming products.

4-Trends Over Time:

A line chart at the bottom of the dashboard tracks Total Actual Sales and Total Budget over time by quarter,
highlighting performance trends and fluctuations.

5-Sales by Product:
A bar chart displays Total Sales by Product, providing a visual comparison of sales performance across different products.

6-Filter Options:
Slicers enable users to filter data by Year, Quarter, and Product, allowing for more detailed analysis and comparison.

Process Overview:

1-Data Cleaning:
I started by cleaning the raw data to remove any inconsistencies and errors, ensuring a reliable dataset for analysis.

2-Data Profiling:
I performed data profiling to understand the structure, quality, and potential issues within the dataset, which informed subsequent data processing steps.

3-Data Processing:
The cleaned data was then processed and organized to facilitate accurate and meaningful analysis.

4-Data Analysis:
I analyzed the processed data to uncover trends, patterns, and variances, which formed the basis for the visualizations.

5-Data Visualization:
I designed and built the dashboard, using a combination of gauge charts, bar charts, and line charts to present a comprehensive view of the data.

Conclusion:
This Power BI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for financial analysis, enabling stakeholders to quickly assess how actual sales compare to 
budgeted figures and identify areas for improvement. By providing both high-level and detailed insights, it supports informed decision-making and strategicÂ planning.
